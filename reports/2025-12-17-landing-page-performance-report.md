## Root Cause Analysis

### Why PPC Traffic Is Bouncing

**Primary Issue: Intent Mismatch**

Our highest-volume keywords are attracting the wrong audience:

| Keyword | Intent | Our Offering | Result |
|---------|--------|--------------|--------|
| "automated content creation tools" | Looking for DIY software | Done-for-you service | Immediate bounce |
| "content marketing: social media" | Broad/research intent | Specific service | Immediate bounce |

Visitors searching for "tools" expect self-service software. Our landing page opens with "Say Goodbye to DIY Marketing" — the opposite of what they want. They leave within seconds.

### Secondary Issues

1. **Mobile Experience** — 100% bounce rate on mobile PPC traffic suggests page load or UX issues
2. **Ad Quality** — Google flagging all ads as "Poor" limits impression share and increases costs
3. **Tracking Gaps** — Some PPC traffic not properly attributed, limiting optimization ability

---

## What's Working

1. **Organic search traffic** shows strong engagement (14+ minute sessions, 53% engagement rate)
2. **RB2B visitor identification** capturing real prospects — 17 companies/individuals identified
3. **Direct traffic** from campaign awareness showing reasonable engagement
4. **CTR on ads** (4.78%) is within acceptable range — people are clicking, just not converting

## Budget Impact
